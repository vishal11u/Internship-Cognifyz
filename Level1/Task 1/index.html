                Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or
                web applications. It encompasses a broad range of tasks and skills,
                including web design, front-end development, back-end development, and
                database management. Front-end development involves creating the user
                interface and user experience, typically using languages such as HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development involves server-side
                programming and managing the server, often utilizing languages like
                Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js. The back end is responsible for
                handling data, security, and business logic. Web developers also work
                with databases to store and retrieve information efficiently. The
                development process often includes collaboration among designers,
                developers, and other stakeholders. With the constant evolution of
                technologies and frameworks, web development is a dynamic field that
                requires continuous learning to stay updated and deliver modern,
                responsive, and secure web solutions.
